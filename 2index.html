    <h3> How to care for your tropical plant</h3>
<div class=succulents>
    <ol>
      <li class="text-one"><strong>1. Watering instructions</strong></li>
      <p class="text-5">Most tropical plants like their soil to stay evenly moist, but not wet. This can be tricky to get just right. Many common houseplants will tolerate being under watered once and a while, but overwatering is the number one cause of death for tropical indoor plants. So, try not to allow either extreme to happen.
                        Check the soil regularly, and only water houseplants if they need it. To see if a plant needs water, stick your finger down about an inch into the soil. If the soil feels wet, then it doesn’t need to be watered.</p>
      <li class="text-two"><strong>2. Humidity requirements</strong></li>
      <p class="text-6">Most common tropical houseplants will easily adapt to living indoors where the air isn’t usually very humid. Some plants are more sensitive to it than others though, and it never hurts to add more humidity to the air when it’s dry.
                        You can run a humidifier near them, or mist them on a regular basis using a plant mister. You could try putting your plants on top of pebble trays filled with water (don’t allow the plant to sit in the water though).</p>
      <li class="text-three"><strong>3. Light Requirement </strong></li>
      <p class="text-7">If you put a plant that prefers low light in a sunny window, it can burn their leaves and could kill the plant. On the other hand, if you try growing houseplants like croton, rubber tree, and some varieties of dracenas without much light, they will start to lose their color and grow long and leggy.
                        So, if any of your tropical plants have started to grow leggy and are reaching for the window, or they have lost their color, that means they need more light. Move the plant to a sunnier spot, or add indoor plant lights.
                        On the other hand, if you are growing plants indoors in a sunny window and the leaves start to burn, then move them to an area where they’re protected from the hot sun.</p>
    </ol>

    <h3> Common tropical houseplants care problems</h3>
    <p><strong>Dull leaf colour:  </strong>When brightly colored plants start to fade and look dull, that’s usually caused by a lack of light. Dull leaf color is easily fixed by simply moving the plant to a brighter location, or adding a grow light. See the section above for more information about recommended lighting.<p>
    <p><strong>Brown or yellow leaves:  </strong>Brown or yellow leaves are common problems for tropical houseplants, and are usually caused by lack of humidity, or improperly watering indoor plants. See both the section about how to water plants, and the humidity section above for details on how to fix those issues.</p>
    <p><strong>Weak, leggy growth:  </strong>Weak or leggy growth is usually a sign that the plant isn’t getting enough light. Plants that aren’t getting enough light will reach for the nearest light source, so you may notice your plant is starting to lean to one side as well. Move the plant closer to a sunny window or add a grow light. See the lighting requirements section above for more details.</p>
    <p><strong>Leaves drooping:  </strong>If a houseplant suddenly starts to droop or sag, that usually means it’s either being over watered or it isn’t getting enough water. Check the moisture level by sticking your finger one inch into the soil. If it’s wet, then allow the soil to dry out before watering again. If the soil is dry, then give the plant a good drink of water. I recommend getting a soil moisture gauge to help make watering a snap. See the section above to learn how to keep your houseplant perfectly watered.</p>
